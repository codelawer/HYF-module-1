# Week 3: CLI lecture

[lecture.sh](lecture.sh) contains the commands used during the lecture.

The other files are just example data used by the demonstrated commands.

You can also have a look at the [official HYF lecture guide](https://github.com/HackYourFuture/CommandLine/blob/master/Week2/Lecture.md).
